git clone https://github.com/dockersamples/linux_tweep_app
 we are cloning a lap repo repo into a new subdirectory
now lets run some docker containers 
we will run a single task in an alpine linux container 
docker container run alpine hostname 
this command will make docker auto pull the alpine image from docker hub 
then it will display the container hostname 
the container stops once the process running exits, otherwise it keeps running
docker does not delete container resources by default - the container stops bur exists in exited state
you can check this using the docker container ls - al
containers can be run to execute a script or configuration without hte need of the actual scripp or conf info.
>>>>>
>>>>>
to run the container based on a different version of linux than the one running on the docker host 
we run an interactive ubuntu container

docker container run -it --rm ubuntu bash
-- rm tells the docker to go ahead and remove the container when its done executing 
this means we wont see the ubuntu bash when we run docker container ls --all

the first two commands allow  u to be interactive with the docker container
type exit to leave the shell session, terminate the bash process, cause the container to exit
......
.....
..............
background MYSQL container 
let run a new MYSQL container 

docker container run \
--detach \
--name mydb \
-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw \
mysql:latest

--detach means the container will run the background 
--name means will be its name mysql 
-e will use a environment variable to specify the root password 
mysql image is not available locally, docker automatically pulled it from docker hub


commans to check on your container
docker container ls 
docker container logs mydb


network traffic cannot reach containers from the host unless ports are explicitly published 
list mysql version 
docker container exec 
this command allows you to run commands inside container 

docker exec -it mydb \
mysql --user=root --password=$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD --version

docker exec -it mydb sh 
  # this connects a new shell process inside an already running container, giving upi an 
  # interactive shell sh inside you MYSQL container.
to leave the interactive shell type exit



LETS PACKAGE AND RUN A CUSTOM APP USING DOCKER
