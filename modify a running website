  a running website does not need to be stoped, rebuild and run everytime you change source code
  there need to streamline changes made on host to reflect immediately in container
  this can be achieved through bind mount 
  when you use a bind mount, a file or directory on the host machine is mounted into a container running on the smae host.


  1. start the web app and mount current dirrectory into the container 

  docker container run \
  --detach \
  --publish 80:80 \
  --name linux_tweet_app \
  --mount type=bind,source="$(PWD)",target=/usr/share/nginx/htmml \
  $DOCKERID/linux_tweet_app:1.0
